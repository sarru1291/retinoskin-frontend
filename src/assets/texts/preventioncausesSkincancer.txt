Prevention from Skin Cancer:
1. Seek the shade, especially between 10 AM and 4 PM.
2. Don't get sunburned.
3. Avoid tanning and never use UV tanning beds.
4. Cover up with clothing, including a broad-brimmed hat and UV-blocking sunglasses.
5.Use a broad spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher every day. For extended outdoor activity, use a water-resistant, broad spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.
6. Apply 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of sunscreen to your entire body 30 minutes before going outside. 7.Reapply every two hours or after swimming or excessive sweating.
8.Keep newborns out of the sun. Sunscreens should be used on babies over the age of six months.
9.Examine your skin head-to-toe every month.

Causes of Skin cancer:
1. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is the number one cause of skin cancer, but UV light from tanning beds is just as harmful. Exposure to sunlight during the winter months puts you at the same risk as exposure during the summertime.

2. Cumulative sun exposure causes mainly basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer, while episodes of severe blistering sunburns, usually before age 18, can cause melanoma later in life. Other less common causes are repeated X-ray exposure, scars from burns or disease, and occupational exposure to certain chemicals.
See a dermatologist at least once a year for a professional skin exam.
